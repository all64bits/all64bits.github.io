The ability of software tools to do hyperlinking seems to have seriously muddled the basic concept of Zettelkasten. Although it might be that this was never particularly unified, and I just think of Luhman’s system as the “true Zettelkasten”.

Many discussions seem to suggest that Zettelkasten is merely the use of sequential ID numbers for note identification, rather than using note titles etc. My preference is for the use of the Luhman-style expanding tree ID’s - i.e. first note is 1, next related note is 1b, next unrelated note is 2, next note related to 1b is 1b1, and so on.

Further to this, I like the idea of using note filenames in the style “ZK_ID (Note title).md”. That way I can search by either ZK ID or note title.

There are other considerations to a solid Zettelkasten system, such as index notes and topic notes etc.
